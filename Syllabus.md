This is where my "syllabus" info goes.
Let's see what happens when I just copy and paste from Word:

MIND & BRAIN, FALL 2021
26:830:557
Mondays, 1:00 – 3:50 pm, Smith 371 (Multipurpose Room)

Office Hours: Mondays 4 – 5, or by appointment. 337 Smith Hall. The best way to reach me is by email (william.graves@rutgers.edu) or in person right after class.

Course Overview: This graduate course offers students a chance to delve deeply into several aspects of how the brain implements the mind. Ultimately the goal is to develop an understanding of what is known and is not yet known about the brain mechanisms behind mental events. Topics are presented incrementally. We start by building a vocabulary of spatial locations for brain areas and networks, along with key methods used in the studies. Brain locations will then be mapped onto mental representations and processes throughout the course, through a series of readings and, critically, writing a plan for your own study of a relevant topic in grant format.

Masks: To protect the health and wellbeing of all members of the Rutgers-Newark 
community, masks must be worn by all persons inside campus buildings when in the 
presence of others, and in buildings in non-private enclosed settings (e.g., common 
workspaces, workstations, meeting rooms, classrooms, etc.). Masks should securely 
cover the nose and mouth, and must be worn during class meetings. Each day 
before you arrive on campus or leave your residence hall, you must complete the brief 
survey on the My Campus Pass symptom checker self-screening app found at: myRutgers Portal.

Learning Objectives: Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to
•	Identify major neuroanatomical structures and how they are known to contribute to aspects of the mind
•	Identify tractable research topics related to the implementation of the mind in the brain
•	Develop a research proposal from initial topic through to a final draft
•	Perform constructive peer review on scientific proposals
•	Respond to and incorporate peer reviews into a research proposal
•	Critically evaluate hypotheses and theoretical models related to the brain mechanisms of mind with respect to experimental results

Course Materials: The current version of the syllabus and the readings will be available on Google Drive here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UrkN620rt5wtSqyi-ZxhtNrcf5s-pEem?usp=sharing

Course Requirements:
(1)	In each class session (excepting the first), students will lead discussion of the assigned articles. This does not mean the student leading the discussion must talk the entire time. Rather, he or she will, for example, elicit questions from the other students and seek clarification where needed. Students NOT leading the discussion must submit at least one discussion topic or question on the reading by email to the discussion leader and copy to william.graves@rutgers.edu. This must be done by 11:59 PM on the day before class.
(2)	Class participation will be weighted heavily. At minimum you must be present to participate in discussions, so attendance is mandatory. The best way to prepare for discussion is to read the article to be presented. To get the most out of this course, we will need insightful, cooperative discussion. Should attending a class session be impossible due to illness, for example, you should contact me to work out a plan to catch up.
(3)	The final project will be an NIH (National Institutes of Health) NRSA (National Research Service Award)-style grant application. This was selected to be maximally relevant to actual scientific career skills. It will be due in stages according to the schedule below, and can be related to any topic covered in the course. Official guidelines from the NIH are provided here:
https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-21-051.html

Assessment:
	Your final grade will be calculated as follows:
	Discussion topic/question email	10%
	Class attendance			10%
	Contribution to class discussion	10%
Total participation:				30%

NRSA-style grant:					Due Date:
	Specific aims				5%	Rough aims, 10/4; Final aims, 11/1
	First draft				15%	Monday, 11/22
	Two peer reviews			15%	Monday, 12/6
	Class presentation			 5%	Monday, 12/13, in class
	Response to reviews			 5%	Monday, 12/20
	Final draft				25%	Monday, 12/20
Total project:					70%

Grading scale:
A: 100-90	B+: 89-86	B: 85-80	C+: 79-76	C: 75-70	D: 69-62

Academic Integrity:
Students are expected to do your own work at all times. Those caught cheating, or who give the appearance of cheating, will be dismissed from class. The University and I take cheating very seriously. Students caught cheating may be suspended or expelled. To help you avoid this situation, please familiarize yourself with the University policy on academic integrity outlined here: http://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu.

Notes:
•	The deadline to drop a course without penalty is September 10, 2021. 
•	The deadline to withdraw from a course with a W grade is November 22, 2021. 
•	If you need accommodation for a learning disability, I will need to see an official Letter of Accommodation from Disability Services (https://ods.rutgers.edu/). This helps me know the best way to help you.
